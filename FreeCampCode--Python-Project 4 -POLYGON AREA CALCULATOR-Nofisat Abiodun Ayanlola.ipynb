    "Polygon Area Calculator You will be working on this project with our Replit starter code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rectangle class When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with width and height attributes. The class should also contain the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "set_width set_height get_area: Returns area (width * height) get_perimeter: Returns perimeter (2 * width + 2 * height) get_diagonal: Returns diagonal ((width * 2 + height ** 2) ** .5) get_picture: Returns a string that represents the shape using lines of \"\". The number of lines should be equal to the height and the number of \"*\" in each line should be equal to the width. There should be a new line (\\n) at the end of each line. If the width or height is larger than 50, this should return the string: \"Too big for picture.\". get_amount_inside: Takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument. Returns the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations). For instance, a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 8 could fit in two squares with sides of 4. Additionally, if an instance of a Rectangle is represented as a string, it should look like: Rectangle(width=5, height=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Square class The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle. When a Square object is created, a single side length is passed in. The init method should store the side length in both the width and height attributes from the Rectangle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Square class should be able to access the Rectangle class methods but should also contain a set_side method. If an instance of a Square is represented as a string, it should look like: Square(side=9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the set_width and set_height methods on the Square class should set both the width and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage example rect = shape_calculator.Rectangle(10, 5) print(rect.get_area()) rect.set_height(3) print(rect.get_perimeter()) print(rect) print(rect.get_picture())\n",
    "\n",
    "sq = shape_calculator.Square(9) print(sq.get_area()) sq.set_side(4) print(sq.get_diagonal()) print(sq) print(sq.get_picture())\n",
    "\n",
    "rect.set_height(8) rect.set_width(16) print(rect.get_amount_inside(sq)) That code should return:\n",
    "\n",
    "50 26 Rectangle(width=10, height=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "81 5.656854249492381 Square(side=4)\n",
    "\n",
    "8 The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development Write your code in shape_calculator.py. For development, you can use main.py to test your shape_calculator() function. Click the \"run\" button and main.py will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing We imported the tests from test_module.py to main.py for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the \"run\" button."
